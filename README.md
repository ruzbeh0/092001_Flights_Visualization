# Summary
A visualization which shows daily flights across the US during the month of September 2001. 
It shows total flights by origin/destination and percentage of cancelled flights.

# Design
The visualization is shown as a trip matrix, where the x axis represents destinations and
the y axis represents origins. It is not intended to show flights for all airports in the US,
but to be a representation of the most important airports and show how disruptive the 09/11 
was to the system.

# Feedback
04/22 - Jonathan Black: Improved visualization of cancelled flights, by representing them as colors instead
of bubble size.
04/22 - Jonathan Black: Added representation of total flights by using bubble size.
04/24 - Jonathan Black: Added legend to better explain the visualization context.
