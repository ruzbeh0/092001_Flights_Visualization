# Summary
A visualization which shows daily flights across the US during the month of September 2001. 
It shows total flights by origin/destination and percentage of cancelled flights.

# Design
The visualization is shown as a trip matrix, where the x axis represents destinations and
the y axis represents origins. A trip matrix format was chosen as it the most used format
to represent trips in the transportation industry.

The visualization is not intended to show flights for all airports in the US,
but to be a representation of the most important airports and show how disruptive the 
09/11 terrorist attack was to the system. 

Two different sets of information are shown: total flights and percentage of cancelled 
flights. Total flights are represented by bubble size while percentage of cancelled 
flights are represented with colors. Colors was selected for the cancelled flights since
it is the most affected variable by the terrorist event and the impact of the color change
is more noticeable.

# Feedback
